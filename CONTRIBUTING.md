# Contribution Rules and Guides

Since this project has been made open source and it means we need contributors from all around the world to participate in the project, this guide has been put toghether to help you understand how the contribution procedure is working. 

_WARNING_: No matter how perfect is you contribution, if it's not following the rules and guidelines of this document, it'll get rejected. 

## Guideline

- Find one of _To Do's_ from [TODO List](README.md#todo-list) and make sure it's not done (PR's may take a while to be approved.)
- Fork this repo to your own github account
- Make a branch for your own contribution (name doesn't matter, but if it fits what you're adding to the project, is cool)
- Make changes as mentioned in _Rules_ section. 
- Create a pull request. 

## Rules

- DO NOT change the whole code base. Just the parts needed. The codebase is working and has its own integrity. 
- DO NOT push codes which are not tested. You always can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)'s free tier to test the code. If you own a good GPU (like a 2080 Ti) you're probably able to test the code on a local machine. 
- DO NOT spam PR, like adding your name into `README.md` file (Yes, I know those _code gurus_ are encouraging this, but it's just pointless spam).
- Every _pull request_ or _issue_ must be in English only. If you can't speak English, then use an online translator or AI to translate your message to English. 
- The rules may change at anytime. Keep your forks or clones updated with this repo's _main_ branch in order to stay up to date with the rules. 

## AI generated code

The use of AI generated code is not prohibited but also is encouraged as long as it doesn't violate our contribution rules. In order to generate a cleaner codebase and troubleshooting errors or bugs, we've just ran our code through OpenAI's GPT-5 Codex. So you're allowed to use AI generated code as long as you have tested it and it doesn't mess with the working parts of the code.
